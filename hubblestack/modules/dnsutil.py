    Send a dns A lookup out to the cloud. We don't really care about the
    result. The idea is to generate identifiable traffic to audit (or at least
    compare) to captured network traffic data.

    The first positional param (actually a keyword param "dom"), allows for
    changing the top level domain of the query. The default is "superfake.tld".
    Probably this is fine for situations where NXDOMAIN results are acceptable,
    since it's unlikely .tld will ever be a real top level domain.

def PTR(addr):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name

    Return a PTR record for ``addr``.

    This function differs somewhat from A and AAAA above. It works on both ipv4
    and ipv6 addresses without having to reverse anything or spell out
    ".in-addr.arpa", but it also returns scalars rather than lists.

    socket.gethostbyaddr() does not return the convenient list of results that
    socket.getaddrinfo() does; so without implementing a heavy-weight actual
    DNS client, enumerating the list of PTR records isn't a resonable thing to
    do.

    âˆ´ PTR() returns a single scalar name, not a list; probably a round-robin
    result, assuming no other caching is taking place.

    .. code-block:: bash
